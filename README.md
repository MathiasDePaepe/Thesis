# Thesis
This GitHub is the used code scripts for the thesis "Depth camera based sense and avoid for drones".
In the first instance, SRF.py has implemented for object detection and avoidance.
With this code, a mission is set up in mission.py.
A remark on this GitHub: SURF.py had practical realized en it is able to compile and execute on the drone. De code mission.py is more a theoretical approach of the "Picture and Fly"-algoritm. 
The code cpu.py tests the usage of the CPU for the objectdetection and localisation where endpoint is checked.
