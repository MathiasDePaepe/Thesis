# Thesis
This GitHub is the used code scripts for the thesis "Depth camera based sense and avoid for drones".
In the first instance, 'SURF.py' has implemented for object detection and avoidance.
With this code, a mission is set up in mission.py.
A remark on this GitHub: 'SURF.py' had practical realized en it is able to compile and execute on the drone. De code 'mission.py' is more a theoretical approach of the "Picture and Fly"-algoritm. 
The code 'cpu.py' tests the usage of the CPU for the objectdetection and localisation where the endpoint is checked.
The excel file 'meetresultaten.xlsx' is a bundling of the experimental results who are described in the script.
